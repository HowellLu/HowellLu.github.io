This was a project that utilized mostly IPEDS and NCES data and attempted to be a better version of the College Navigator. One specific experiment was to see how well LLM’S could write SQL Queries from normal written language and return valid queries within the framework of a database (Not sure if I still have any API credits left), but one can just use the search feature manually otherwise. The end product was this website, which was built with Streamlit and Python.
