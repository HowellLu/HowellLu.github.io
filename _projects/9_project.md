This is a project from the course Math 4430: Stochastic Processes. It proves that the metropolis algorithm is reversible, irreducible and aperiodic. It further applies the Metropolis Algorithms to a modified Travelling Salesman Problem to compute the average number of turns it takes for someone to return to their starting point.
