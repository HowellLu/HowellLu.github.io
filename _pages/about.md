I am broadly interested in interactive statistical tools and on determining how population level effects and insights can be reliably transported to model individual attributes and guide individual decision-making. This manifests in projects and interests which specifically involve: Bayesian non-parametric statistics, causal inference, longitudinal data, transportability, high dimensional data, sequence history analysis and functional data analysis. These interests combine into this general research question: *How can one capture and model longitudinal heterogeneity, especially when conditioned on unreliably captured individual attributes and having to transport causal effects from varying studies?* 

Some fields that I am currently exploring are personalized health and decision science.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, playing video games and being a terrible musician.
